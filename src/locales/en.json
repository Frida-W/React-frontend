      "title7": "When do I get the partner money?",
      "content7": "You get money onto your partner balance every time your referrals deposit on RSkins.com. Partner balance can be used to get skins you've chosen or it can be transferred to your main balance to play on the site.",
      "title8": "What is the promo code for?",
      "content8": "Partner promo code, same as referral link, gives +5% bonus to your referrals for every deposit.",
      "title9": "What will my promo code look like?",
      "content9": "Automatically, you get a unique number as promo code, but you can change it whenever you want for any combination that is vacant. Your new promo code should contain only Latin alphabet letters, numbers 0-9. \nNote, that RSkins may reset your promo code if it's being already promoted by someone else or for other reasons.",
      "title10": "Does the user remain a referral of the first partner forever?",
      "content10": "Users can change the referral relationship by modifying the referrer code.",
      "title11": "Who is a referral?",
      "content11": "A user who followed a partner link or used a promo code. A referral belongs to the partner, whose promo code or partner link he/she used prior to filling the balance.",
      "title12": "I gave my referral link to many people, but I didn't receive the partner money. What's wrong?",
      "content12": "There are two possible reasons: Your referrals followed your link but didn't fill their balance on the site. Your referrals used a partner link/promo code of another partner just before making the deposit.",
      "title13": "Where can I promote my code?",
      "content13": "You can promote your partner code on other sites and in social media. You can not advertise it in search networks. It should be clear for people that they use the referral link/code of the certain partner. \nIt is forbidden to use browser extensions (like Honey, CouponBirds etc.) for advertising your promo code.",
      "title14": "What restrictions does the partner system have?",
      "content14": "The only aim of the RSkins Partner system is to attract new players to the site by promoting partners' promo codes and links. This is what our partners get rewarded for. It goes without saying that we do not tolerate any kind of abusing our Partner & Bonus system (including using multiple accounts or offering users any payment for using your affiliate code, or giving cashback in any form for deposits with a particular code, and so forth). According to our Terms & Conditions, the accounts suspected of such abuse will be blocked immediately and without prior notice. \nNote that we pay partner money for real promotion, not for taking short & easy codes (e.g. numbers, letters, RSkins related words/phrases and so forth) which will be used without any efforts on the part of their owners. We may restrict such accounts at our own discretion. \nIt is also forbidden to use the codes that closely resonate with the famous influencers' codes (e.g. misplaced symbols, extra symbols, typos-like symbols, etc). Users with such promo codes violate the rules of our Partner program and their accounts will be restricted.",
